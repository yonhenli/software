# Virtual Memory System Implementation
### Description:
This project helps to understand the virtual memory system and how to manage a relative large project across multiple files.

### Highlights:
1. Designed and implemented a virtual memory system that simulates address translation, page table lookup, and page fault handling
2. Built a memory model that tracks page faults, TLB miss/hit, memory read/write accesses and disk accesses for an application

### Build:
```sh
make vsim
```
